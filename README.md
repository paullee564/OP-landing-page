Odin project CSS project: Landing page

This is a project where I'm given an image of a landing page of a website and clone it from scratch with HTML and CSS. 

What I've learned:

1) How to build a website in general. Previously, I didn't understand at all how to make a decent looking website. I understand that this is nothing compared to the more intricate website I'll be able to build in the future, but it doesn't look half bad.
2) How to use flex. I understand how to use flex to put certain elements in different positions and using flex containers in flex containers, flex-direction, and how to manipulate them.
3) The time and patience it takes to build a website. It took a lot longer that I thought. Because HTML and CSS seems to be simple and more repetitive I thought it'd be quick and easy but it took 3 sessions.
